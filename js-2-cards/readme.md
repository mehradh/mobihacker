data.xml contains some text. The text is split into 3 `<card>`s and each card is made of a title and some `<p>`aragraphs.

Create a simple script to render the read and render the content in the XML similar to this video (cards-navigation.mov),

In the video, the user can navigate through the cards by clicking on Next and Back buttons.

Cards are occupying the 100% of the viewport (except for margin and navigation at bottom).

You can use jQuery standard library, but no other jQuery plugin.

The product should work on all modern browsers (including IE 11).

---

Bonous: implement the navigation for touch devices (iPhone and Androids).
